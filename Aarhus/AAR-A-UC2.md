### Pain

The pain that this tool solves for the user is the lack of automated analysis for judging "soft" human-centred criteria at the early design stage. Currently, design teams have to manually assess and make subjective judgments on the impact of design decisions on human-centred criteria. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks transparency.

By using this tool, the design team can receive evidence-based feedback on which human-centred criteria are (potentially) impacted based on their design decisions. This allows them to make more informed design choices and improve the quality of the building design. The tool provides visible, transparent, and traceable assessments, allowing architects to understand the underlying logic and source research literature of the human-centred assessment.

Additionally, the tool enables the integration of human-centred information into the BIM model through spatial artefacts. These spatial artefacts capture qualitative experiences and contribute to the overall subjective impressions that occupants are predicted to experience. This helps architects to consider the impact of their design decisions on factors such as lighting, visibility, health, safety, air quality, and thermal comfort. Overall, the tool reduces the subjectivity and uncertainty at the early design stage and provides architects with valuable insights to optimize the building design.



### Gain

The gain for the tool user is that they are able to receive evidence-based feedback on human-centred aspects at a relatively early design stage. This feedback is obtained through the automated analysis of "soft" human-centred criteria in the design space. The tool provides the architect with a visual representation of the analysis results in the form of spatial artefacts in the 3D BIM software. The architect can then explore and understand the impact of certain design decisions on human-centred criteria by clicking on the spatial artefacts. The tool also provides access to the underlying logic and research literature used for the human-centred assessment, ensuring transparency and traceability in the assessments made. This enables the architect to make more informed design decisions and improve the overall quality and user experience of the building design.
