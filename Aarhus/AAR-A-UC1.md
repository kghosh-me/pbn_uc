### Gain

The gain for the tool user is that it provides instant feedback on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) impacts at a relatively early design stage. This allows the user, in this case the architect, to make informed decisions about the design of the building in regards to the estimated CO2 footprint, energy consumption, and other LCA metrics.

Specifically, the tool addresses two problems faced by the design team. Firstly, it provides information on LCA metrics even when the specific details of the design are lacking. This means that even in the early stages of design where details such as materials and geometries are not yet finalized, the architect can still have an estimation of the environmental impact of the design.

Secondly, the tool helps to identify design sensitivities by highlighting the aspects in the design where changes are likely to have a drastic impact on the LCA metrics. This allows the architect to focus on these "hot spots" and make changes that will have the most significant positive impact on the environmental performance of the building.

The tool also provides quick calculations of the LCA metrics, updating them in real-time as the design evolves. This is crucial as it allows the architect to explore alternative design decisions and see the immediate impact on the LCA metrics. The feedback is provided visually, using color-coded building elements, making it easy for the architect to understand and interpret the information.

Overall, the tool enables the architect to make sustainability-oriented design decisions at an early stage, optimizing the building's environmental performance and reducing its carbon footprint. It empowers the architect to consider and evaluate different design options and their impact on LCA metrics, ultimately leading to more sustainable and environmentally-friendly buildings.
